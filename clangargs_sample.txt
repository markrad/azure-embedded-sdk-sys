# This is an example of clangargs.txt. By creating this file the user can pass
# additional arguments to the clang invocation used to convert the C header 
# files to rust bindings. Each option must be on a seperate line. Any line 
# that does not begine with a hyphen (-) will be ignored.

# Example of passing an additional include directory:
-I/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/7/include/

# Turn on verbose for debugging
